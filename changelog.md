### Farmer's Delight
1. Removed flint knife to encourage early-game use of bone knife.

### Rechiseled
1. The chisel has been removed, and now blocks are crafted through Chipped workstations.

### Natural Progression
1. The flint saw has been removed for balancing purposes.
2. The bone knife has been removed due to content overlap with Delightful.
3. More animals have been added to the `natprog:drops_bones` tag.

### Delightful
1. Bone knife now uses bone shard (natprog) instead of bone.
2. Naturally spawning salmonberry bushes now use the real crop rather than the "wild salmonberries" block.

### Minecraft
1. Removed wooden tool recipes.
2. Removed stone tool recipes.
3. Removed end rod recipe (overlap with new recipe from Outer End).

### General
1. Removed all wood-to-plank conversion recipes. This now must be achieved via stripping and cutting board, or more advanced means.
